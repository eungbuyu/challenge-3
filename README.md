# Challenge 3 - Crypto Arbitrage

For this project, I used the data files "bitstamp.csv" and "coinbase.csv", which contained the prices of bitcoin in the Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges, respectively, for the time period 2018-01-01 to 2018-03-31, or the first quarter of 2018. They are included in the repo in the "Resources" folder. 

## Technologies
I imported the following libraries:

```
pandas
pathlib
%matplotlib inline
```
The **Path** tool from the the **pathlib** library was used to read in the .csv files into **Jupyter Lab**, which utilized many of the tools from **pandas** and **%matplotlib inline** to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
